**The inputs are integers and will only accept up to eight hexidecimal numbers otherwise it will throw an error**

The encryption program is going to ask for user input for K[0-3] and L[0] and R[0]
It will output what the user input was for K[0-3] and show L[0-2] and R[0-2]
The output will give you 8 digits from the hex string even if you give it less

The decryption program is going to ask for user input for K[0-3] and L[2] and R[2]
It will have the same output as the encryption program
